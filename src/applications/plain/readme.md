This is the simplest of inclusions. If a property needs a simple header and footer with all buttons and no additional processing, then it can use this

```html
<script async src="https://assets.library.uq.edu.au/reusable-webcomponents/uq-lib-reusable.min.js"></script>
<script async src="https://assets.library.uq.edu.au/reusable-webcomponents/applications/plain/load.js"></script>
```

(note: assets.library.uq.edu.au/reusable-webcomponents maps to s3 bucket uql-reusable-webcomponents-production/reusable-webcomponents)
