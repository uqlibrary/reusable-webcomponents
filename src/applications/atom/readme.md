# Atom

The Fryer collection is implemented with a software package called Atom, from <https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/>.

The live server is at <https://manuscripts.library.uq.edu.au/>

The staging server is at <https://sandbox-fryer.library.uq.edu.au/> (VPN required). Ask Rohan (or Dan) for access. 
Staging uses branch `atom-staging`.
