# secure collections

Secure collections appear at e.g. <https://files.library.uq.edu.au/collection/?collection=documents&file=Tincture_Journal_Issue_Thirteen_(Autumn_2016).pdf> (This can also be found by searching at <https://search.library.uq.edu.au> in Journals for "Tincture" and clicking through the result)

We supply several Web Components to this page: header, footer, etc - and the special `secure-collection` component
